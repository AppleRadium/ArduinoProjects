## Morse Machine

The Morse Machine is a simple Morse code translator built using an **Arduino Uno**, **KY-008 Laser Emitter**, **KY-012 Buzzer**, and a **KY-040 Rotary Encoder**.

The system takes text input (letters **A–Z** and numbers **0–9**), translates it into Morse code according to the **ITU Morse Code standard**, and outputs the result in two formats:
- **Visual** output via the laser emitter
- **Audio** output via the buzzer

The rotary encoder is used to control:
- **Volume**
- **Playback speed**

These two modes can be toggled by pressing the rotary encoder.
