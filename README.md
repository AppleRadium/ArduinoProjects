##Morse Machine
  This is a simple Morse code translator created using an Arduino Uno, a KY-008 Laser Emitter, a KY-012 Buzzer, and a KY-040 Rotary Encoder. It takes text 
  (letters A to Z and numbers 0 - 9) as input, translates the text into Morse code (according to the ITU Morse code standard) and outputs the Morse code in both visual
  (on the laser) and audio (on the buzzer) format. The rotary encoder is used for both volume and speed control. These two modes can be toggled by pressing on the encoder.
